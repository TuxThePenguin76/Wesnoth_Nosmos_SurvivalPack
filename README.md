# Wesnoth_Nosmos_SurvivalPack
Fork of the 1.14 add on , an attempt to make it work with Wesnoth 1.16

Add on loads and works with tweaking.

1.14 default behavior (for this mod) was that if an AI did not have an opponent the boss was spawned but did not recruit. But based on reports this is no longer the case  -- FIXED

You have control of the AI setup in 1.16 so only enabling the number of AIs as there are live players works around this issue. I am looking at a fix. -No Longer Needed
